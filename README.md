**Check 📅 https://roadmap.glpi-project.org** for a summary planning of the next years.

For a more technical view, you can also check the dedicated [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/glpi-project/projects/25/views/16) and the [backlog](https://github.com/glpi-project/roadmap/issues)

### 🏷️ Topic Labels

Items are associated with categories, such as:

- `Inventory`

- ...

You can retrieve features associated to this label in [sub views of the technical project](https://github.com/orgs/glpi-project/projects/25/)

## Proposing a new feature

- Consider only new features, bug reports should be opened on [glpi-project/glpi issues](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/issues) and support requests are only managed through [GLPI-Network subscriptions](https://www.glpi-project.org/en/pricing/).
- Please consult [existing issues](https://github.com/glpi-project/roadmap/issues) and [product documentation](https://help.glpi-project.org/) to avoid duplicates
- If you want to contribute yourself, please indicate it in your proposal
- If you wish to fund a feature, please contact us [on our website](https://www.glpi-project.org/en/contact/) or through your channel manager (GLPI-Network partners).

**👉 Propose a new feature on the [📝 discussions space](https://github.com/glpi-project/roadmap/discussions)**

## Improving this dashboard

Pull-requests are welcomed if you want to improve the [published app](https://roadmap.glpi-project.org/) but it's still preferable to open an issue to discuss with us before starting.

## Notes

- We use years, and not GLPI versions, as milestones to communicate when features will come. We include plugins and third-party development in the roadmap as well.
- The public roadmap is purely indicative, features set for a year are not guaranteed to be released in that year. They are just an indication of when we plan to work on them. Also some features may be released earlier than expected.
- When a task or a feature is developed, it will be moved to a "Ready to release" state. You can consider these items to be present in the next version.
- We will delete any content that is not relevant to the roadmap or inappropriate.
